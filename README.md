##DB VERSIONCONTROL PROCEDURE

**Follow CONTRIBUTING guidelines for git**  
Additionally:
ALL SQL OPERATES ON PerpSQL as from the installer
SQL statements then are version controlled in the OPDB repo

** To commit a change w/o key conflicts**  
Pull and catch up to most recent SQL state, run SQL, then make changes freely locally.    
Once you are done, REVERT to the pull state.  
Write your SQL for the singular change(s) (not the history of work/rework/undo/redo).  
Push change.
